                    <p>Our founder, Walter White, opened The Pizza Lab in 2008 after seeing the decline of quality product first hand.  Walter had what most would consider an insane idea and infuse his Chemistry experience with his passion for a top-quality product.  Opening the first location in the heart of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walt began a legacy.  Becoming a success overnight, Gus Fring of Los Pollos Hermanos funded the growth of The Pizza Lab into a national pizza giant.  The Pizza Lab now has over 30 locations in the Southwest United States and is continually opening locations in new markets.</p>
                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>To provide the very best quality product to everyone that deserves the right to taste high standards.  To remain innovative in this competitive market and provide the most addictive product ever.  We want to make a product that keeps you coming back for more.</p>
